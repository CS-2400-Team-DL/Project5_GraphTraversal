# Project5_GraphTraversal
Understand graph and its representations (adjacency matrix and adjacency list). Implement graph traversal algorithms (Breadth-First Traversal and Depth-First Traversal).

## TODO

In Both Task Create the graph:

    The graph { V, E } where 
    
    V = { A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I }
    
    E = { (A, B), (A, D), (A, E), (B, E), (D, G), (E, F), (E, H), (G, H), (F, C), (F, H), (H, I), (C, B), (I, F) }

    Using either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.


Task1:

    After creating the graph perform a BREADTH-first traversal of the graph and display the
    order in which the nodes were visited. The traversal begins at the node labeld 'A'.

Task2:

    After creating the graph perform an iterative DEPTH-first traversal of the graph and display the
    order in which the nodes were visited. The traversal begins at the node labeld 'A'.

Optionals:
    
    Use Unit Testing (+10)
    Create a Screencasted Video (+10)
    Use Interface and Generics (+10)
